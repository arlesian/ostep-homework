Q1.
./fork.py -s 10
a - b
a - b - c
a - b
a - b
  \ d
a - b
  \ d
  \ e

Q2.
with fork percentage low
    -> shallow tree. mostly 2 layer, luck 3 layers. small # siblings
with fork percentage high
    -> deep tree with lots of siblings

Q3. ./fork.py -a 10 -t
spawn a
a forks b
b exits
a forks c
c forks d
d forks e
a forks f
d forks g
c forks h
d forks i
i forks j

Q4. ./fork.py -A a+b,b+c,c+d,c+e,c- : making orphans
    default seems to be reparent to root, with -R flag, set reparent to local parent

Q5. -F flag : ./fork.py -s 2345 -F
a
└── b
├   └── e
└── c
    └── d
        └── f

Q6. -F and -t flag : is the answer exact?
    -> if # remaining process < # total processes automatically not exact
    -> also even if equal, the order can be permuted
    -> (if diagram is drawn in FIFO style, the solution is exact iff up to one process in each layer has a child)
